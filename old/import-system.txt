It's possible to create a language file
(or use the same user file for it, putting the
languages at the end). Following are some language
examples, but it is recommended to insert the
languages by the web pages directly. See the files
run.sh and compare.sh for compiling/running script and
comparing script respectively.


[language]
langnumber=1
langname=C
langscript=runscriptforlang1.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o runscript 1...
exit 1
***END***
langcompscript=compscriptforlang1.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o compscript 1...
exit 1
***END***

langnumber=2
langname=C++
langscript=runscriptforlang2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o runscript 2...
exit 2
***END***
langcompscript=compscriptforlang2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o compscript 2...
exit 2
***END***

langnumber=3
langname=Java
langscript=runscriptforlang3.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o runscript 3...
exit 3
***END***
langcompscript=compscriptforlang3.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo este eh o compscript 3...
exit 3
***END***
