BOCA Acknowledgments
-------------------
(last updated 21/August/2014)

This is a very important file of BOCA. It gives a list of people we must acknowledge
for having in a way or another helping BOCA reach its current development situation.
They certainly deserve more much thanks than only this file, but it is away a begining.
Moreover, many names are probably still missing here, so if you identify such a case,
please let us know as soon as possible so as to include them here! This file has been
created much after the begining of BOCA, so there will be many many missing names,
do not be shine and do help us to fill this list! Also if you see some incoherency on the
lists, let us know! Thanks!

The list is divided into two section: those who effectively contributed in ideas for the 
code, and those who found bugs and/or suggested modifications. Names are given in 
no particular order.
