   main server and many local servers that connect to it). The

   user named type "site". 
- main site can provide redundancy in case of failure, as it has a
   copy of everything.

   safety. Scripts to judge are now inside the problem package.

- script that creates the bocajail changed to /etc/icpc/createbocajail.sh and some
  improvements are applied (e.g. use of debootstrap). It should now run smoother on 
  ubuntu and other debian-like systems.
- bugfix: general clarification option was not appearing in the list of problems.
- scripts have been updated to make it easy to replace the use of user 'www-data' by 'apache'.
- updatescores.sh now accepts full path names for servers. This solves the case where boca
  is not installed in the default http://SERVER/boca/

  the local boca server decides which info shall be put in the score board. This fixes issues with
  displaying undesired info from other sites, because the responsability is given to local boca.
- webcast directory for F. D. Moreira's fancy score included in the distro.

  network and DB accesses are reduced (Thanks to huge files of Wanderley Guimaraes :).
