See Copyright below.

To simplify the input of user's data, it is
possible to put all information in a text
file, according to three different formats. Two
of them are based on the files generated from the
ICPC website system, usually in TAB separated format. Examples of such
files are in this folder, named PC2_Team.tab and Teams.tsv
The third possible format follows the example below:

************ users.txt: *************
[user]
usernumber=2000
usersitenumber=1
username=cassio
userfullname=Cassio P. de Campos
usertype=admin
userpassword=secret

usernumber=2001
usersitenumber=1
username=judge1
usertype=judge
userfullname=First judge name
userenabled=f
usermultilogin=t
userip=10.0.0.5

usernumber=2002
usersitenumber=1
username=staff1
usertype=staff
userfullname=Staff person name
userpassword=aBcDe

usernumber=1
usersitenumber=1
userfullname=[PUC-SP A] Team A
userdesc=[PUC-SP][Pontificial Universidade Catolica de SP] Nome1, Nome2, Nome3
userip=192.168.0.1
usericpcid=1234

usernumber=2
usersitenumber=1
userfullname=[Team B] Full team B name
userdesc=[InstitutionShortName] Long institution name
userip=192.168.0.2
usericpcid=1111

usernumber=3
usersitenumber=1
userfullname=[Shortname] Long team name
userip=192.168.0.3

**************************************
Note that the "****" lines should not
be included in the text file, only what is between them. Consider
using the ICPC data format, downloaded from the ICPC site, to input
the information about the teams. Note that passwords will be
automatically generated for the teams in such case, and you have to
take note of those passwords. If you re-include the teams using those
file formats, new passwords will be generated, and you must take note again.

The users are defined per block of lines.
Blank lines separate the definitions of the
users. The parameters not specified for a
given user inside its block are set to 
the default values.

The parameters in the user's file are:
usernumber: number of the user in the site
usersitenumber: number of the user's site
username: nickname of the user. If not
	  specified, it's generated from
	  the usernumber, ie, "team"+usernumber
userfullname: institution name and team name or
	      just the user name.
userdesc: detailed description about the user.
usertype: type of the user. If not specified,
	  it's set to "team".
userpassword: if not specified, it's left emtpy.
userenabled: if not specified, the user is enabled.
usericpcid: ID of user in the ICPC system. Not required.
usermultilogin: if not specified, the user cannot
		make simultaneous logins form distinct IPs.
userip: from which IP number the user may connect. A list
    of IPs separated by comma may be specified. IPs may
    have netmasks, such as 10.0.0.0/16, or negations,
    such as !143.107.0.0/16.
